# Deliver-The-Thing
A small shipping application I voluntarily made for an interview in 2 days. My goal was to test how much I could learn about a new industry in a short amount of time. These 2 days also included research on shipping terms, shipping functionality and how to implement them with no guidance. Thankfully, my employer was surprised that I had created this for the interview and was pleased with the results. 

This application allows the user to register and login. Then they can enter two addresses and package information to receive rates for shipping their package from UPS, FedEx, or USPS. They then add or remove any of the given rates to their list of saved rates on their home page. I did not create functionality for printing labels because that would have required making an actual shipment which I did not want to do. I used a free trial of ShipEngine to solicitate the carriers used.
